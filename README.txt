{Abstract}
Our team will be developing a web application that provides SCRUM development organization for software developing teams. 

{Problem Statement}
• During SCRUM development cycle (a specific class example would be CS 441), there seemed to be a lack of accessible automation tools that would allow for software team communication, task tracking and bug tracking.  Most groups default to using a mix of tools and manual documentation methods, such as Excel or Access, in association with GitHub and email communication or outside forums.  
• We would like to implement a website, {s.dot} (SCRUM Developer Online Tracker) that would allow for this type of data to be collected centrally, allowing for easier documentation, centralization and availability, all the while reducing the need for multiple outside tools.

{Target Users}
• Computer sciences students and software development teams. CS 441 class where they are using SCRUM development techniques to make their software. 

{Users Functions}
• {s.dot} would allow the following potential user functions: 

{Bug tracking} 
• History of project task that are currently in progress, being worked on, and completion of task.
• Priority and assignment of task defined by user.
• Tracking of current version of project and side branches of repository for easy view. Also includes description of side branch and purpose. 
• Resource tracking for project; for example external links, books, documentation and its location. 
• Forum to provide communication between project members for easy communication. 
• Manager tracking employees tasks and meeting tracker.
